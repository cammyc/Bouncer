Guidelines

Obvious
- Add css scripts to css folder
- Add ajax scripts to ajaxPhpHandlers folder
- libraries like Materialize go in this folder

Less Obvious
- js folder is for js scripts that have functions that can be re-used throughout the site
- formHandlers is where all the php scripts that interpret form data should go

For new pages like login page, party page, profile, etc...
- Create a Folder like "Login", "Profile", etc... and then in that folder make an index.php file.
  - index.php will act as the main page
